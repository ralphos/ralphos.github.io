title: About me
---

I'm a Ruby developer based in Sydney, Australia.

I previously attended [The Starter League][] in the Spring of 2012 in Chicago and afterwards moved to Manila, Philippines to work out of a Dev shop called [Proudcloud][]. There I worked on client projects and built two startups - [Lovvd][] and [Pinch the Look][].

My current tools of the trade include Ruby 2.0+ and Rails 4.0+, Rspec, Capybara, Factory Girl,  Haml, SASS, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Vim and Tmux. I'm also familiar with AWS, New Relic, KissMetrics, Trello and Balsamiq.

I'm a [Thoughtbot][] fanboy and currently obsessed with getting better at TDD/BDD and finding new ways to apply object-orientated design.

Feel free to check out my [Github][] or follow me on [Twitter][].
