Welcome to Ralph on Rails, my personal blog where I discuss Ruby, Rails and anything else I'm hacking on. I'm hoping this blog will help illustrate my approach to programming and what I'm interested in. With that said, what should you expect to find on Ralph on Rails?

Currently I'm focusing on creating well tested applications using an outside in approach with Rspec & Capybara. I'm also trying to adhere to SOLID principles and apply object-orientated design where possible (whilst reading POODR).

In addition to Rails stuff I'll also occasionally post a few 'practical tips' -  basically things you need to do when building a startup that aren't so much related to programming.

If you're hiring Ruby Developers (prefereably in Sydney, Australia) please reach out to me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ralphwintle) or [email](mailto:wintle.ralph@gmail.com) so we can discuss!
